   abstract = {Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the process of finding out the appropriate meaning of a polysemous word based on any given context. The Bengali language inherently comprises a large number of polysemous words. Recently, researchers in the domain of linguistics have been attracted to the problem of WSD in Bengali text due to its numerous interesting applications, viz. machine translation, opinion polarity identification, question-answering systems, etc. In this paper, lexeme connexion measure of cohesive lexical ambiguity revealing factor has been proposed that takes a decision on the disambiguation of senses of a Bengali polysemous word. All the polysemous words have been treated as target words, and a context window of three different sizes, viz. five, seven, and ten are considered based on these target words. This paper has generated lexeme harmony measure for quantifying heuristically of syntactic belongings of a collection of lexemes in Bengali text. The proposed methodology has been extracted a feature vector by considering the cohesive lexical ambiguity revealing factor or CLARF, depending on frame lexeme harmony (FLH), sense lexeme harmony (SLH), polysemy singularity coherence (PSC), polysemy distribution factor (PDF), and relative polysemy singularity coherence (RPSC) factor of a lexeme. This Bengali WSD technique has been applied max-rule of integrated lexeme connexion measure (LCM) of each lexeme of both the testing and training cases score for sense recognition. The proposed algorithm has succeeded in eliminating the drawback of the Bengali WSD approaches, as it can focus on both the lexical and semantic relationships between words. The performance of this algorithm has been evaluated on a dataset that consists of 100 polysemous words of three/four senses. Various evaluation metrics have been used to analyse the results obtained by the proposed algorithm. The obtained results indicate the robustness of the proposed algorithm.},

   abstract = {Based on the sense definition of words available in the Bengali WordNet, an attempt is made to classify the Bengali sentences automatically into different groups in accordance with their underlying senses. The input sentences are collected from 50 different categories of the Bengali text corpus developed in the TDIL project of the Govt. of India, while information about the different senses of particular ambiguous lexical item is collected from Bengali WordNet. In an experimental basis we have used Naive Bayes probabilistic model as a useful classifier of sentences. We have applied the algorithm over 1747 sentences that contain a particular Bengali lexical item which, because of its ambiguous nature, is able to trigger different senses that render sentences in different meanings. In our experiment we have achieved around 84% accurate result on the sense classification over the total input sentences. We have analyzed those residual sentences that did not comply with our experiment and did affect the results to note that in many cases, wrong syntactic structures and less semantic information are the main hurdles in semantic classification of sentences. The applicational relevance of this study is attested in automatic text classification, machine learning, information extraction, and word sense disambiguation.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we are going to find meaning of words based on distinct situations. Word Sense Disambiguation is used to find meaning of words based on live contexts using supervised and unsupervised approaches. Unsupervised approaches use online dictionary for learning, and supervised approaches use manual learning sets. Hand tagged data are populated which might not be effective and sufficient for learning procedure. This limitation of information is main flaw of the supervised approach. Our proposed approach focuses to overcome the limitation using learning set which is enriched in dynamic way maintaining new data. Trivial filtering method is utilized to achieve appropriate training data. We introduce a mixed methodology having Modified Lesk approach and Bag-of-Words having enriched bags using learning methods. Our approach establishes the superiority over individual Modified Lesk and Bag-of-Words approaches based on experimentation.},

   abstract = {The entities of communication have an enormous impact on interaction. Textual data is an important attribute of communication. Textual analysis of this data is carried out by the linguistic researchers in various perspectives. It helps to understand the peopleâ€™s perception by analyzing the contextual data into its various senses. The sense of a polysemous word is varied according to its context. Hence, the process of identifying the proper meaning of a polysemous word with respect to the context is known as word sense disambiguation (WSD). For the extraction of actual meaning, WSD is an essential technique in Natural Language Processing. Over the last two decades, a lot of algorithms have been proposed to solve this linguistic ambiguity problem in various languages. In addition, a number of review papers have been published in various most spoken languages. Even so, it is elevating that there is a discontinuity in the literature when it comes to the techniques of Bengali WSD. This paper confers an extensive survey work regarding approaches of Bengali WSD. It also presents a survey work of the existing dataset of Bengali WSD.},

   abstract = {The computation of natural language enables a suitable transmission through the universe by retrieving the correct sense of each word. A word may be monosemous or polysemous. The use of polysemous words in an appropriate context plays a critical role in communication. Over the last 2 decades, a significant amount of research has been done for automatically solving the correct sense of a polysemous word in the context of word sense disambiguation. A word sense disambiguation algorithm identifies the proper sense of a polysemous word by analysing the contextual data. Nevertheless, there is a gap in the contemporary literature regarding the availability of datasets in Asian languages, especially Bengali. Therefore, in this work, we have presented a dataset comprising hundred Bengali polysemous words. Each word in this dataset consists of three or four disjoint senses, and each sense comprises ten paragraphs. Each paragraph describes the sense of a particular polysemous word. We have performed statistical analysis on the basis of seven relevant and important characteristics. A general framework has also been presented for training and testing with possible guidelines for performance analysis. A baseline strategy has been introduced based on four feature sets. Finally, a set of experiments have been performed to analyse the system performance.},
